End to End implementation of Text Summary using NLP

This project implements an end-to-end text summarization system using the PEGASUS model. It allows users to generate abstractive summaries of input text using state-of-the-art NLP techniques.

## Notebook Link

The implementation details and examples can be found in the [notebook](research/tests.ipynb).

## Model

We use the PEGASUS model for abstractive summarization. PEGASUS is a state-of-the-art pre-trained model that achieves excellent results on various NLP tasks.
